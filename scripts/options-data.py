# AGENTIC AI ENFORCED SPECIFICATION & GUIDELINES (CRITICAL)
# =============================================================================
# 1. KEEP DOCUMENTATION USEFUL: Preserve accurate docs, but correct or remove
#    stale comments instead of carrying misleading history forward.
# 2. AGENT READ-WRITE RULE: Keep this header synchronized with behavior on every
#    change (mirrors the main.tsx / index.css agentic-guide convention).
# 3. This file is INFRASTRUCTURE for the "build-time static cache" strategy. It
#    is NOT part of the 3-file app source (index.html / index.css / main.tsx).
# =============================================================================
#
# PROJECT: Options Desk — SMART build-time data fetcher
#
# CHANGELOG (append newest at top; keep history accurate):
#   v13 - Index manifest without timestamp churn:
#        * data/index.json `files` is now a sorted ticker LIST (not
#          {TICKER: updatedISO}). Dropped global `generated`.
#        * Freshness / oldest-first refresh use filesystem mtime and the
#          optional in-file `updated` field (weekend dead-zone rule unchanged).
#        * write_index() rewrites only when ticker set, names, or no_options
#          change (or once when migrating off the legacy timestamp shape), so
#          scheduled no-op runs no longer create git commits that only bump
#          datetimes.
#   v12 - No model greeks in the fetcher (single source of truth = UI runtime):
#        * Removed Black-Scholes / higher-order greek computation from this script.
#          Non-standard greeks (λ, vanna, vomma, charm, speed, zomma, color) and
#          full BS fallback for missing 1st-order are computed ONLY in the browser
#          (src/main.tsx → blackScholesGreeks / enrichQuotesWithModelGreeks).
#        * Fetcher still attaches provider-supplied Cboe delayed 1st-order greeks
#          (delta/gamma/theta/vega/rho) when available. No duplicate model math.
#        * Env BLACK_SCHOLES_GREEKS / GREEKS_RISK_FREE_RATE / GREEKS_DIVIDEND_YIELD
#          removed (no-ops if still set in old workflows).
#   v11 - Static-cache greeks enrichment:
#        * fetch_ticker() enriches yfinance chains with free Cboe delayed
#          greeks (delta/gamma/theta/vega/rho) by OCC contract symbol when available.
#        * (superseded by v12) previously also computed Black-Scholes in Python.
#        * Each cache payload includes a top-level `greeks` summary.
#   v10 - Local-index company names for ticker suggestions:
#        * data/index.json now also carries `names: { TICKER: companyName }` for
#          cached tickers and no-options skiplist entries whenever live universe
#          discovery can resolve a human-readable name. The app uses this to show
#          local suggestions like provider-native suggestions (company/fund/index
#          name instead of a generic "Ticker from local index") and to support
#          name-based local search.
#        * Name metadata is collected from the NASDAQ screener (preferred display
#          names such as "Apple Inc. Common Stock") and Cboe optionable-underlying
#          CSV (fallback), then preserved across no-op runs to avoid churn.
#   v9 - No-options skiplist lives in data/index.json:
#        * scripts/no_options.json is REMOVED. The skiplist is now stored as the
#          `no_options` field on data/index.json (alongside `files` / `count` /
#          `generated`), so one manifest tracks both cached tickers and the
#          tickers known to have no listed options.
#        * load_skiplist / save_skiplist / write_index all share data/index.json.
#          A one-shot migration still reads a leftover scripts/no_options.json if
#          present, then deletes it after a successful write.
#        * GitHub Actions only needs to `git add data/` (no separate skiplist path).
#          Note: v10+ app code surfaces this field in ticker suggestions as
#          `(no options)`.
#   v8 - Human-visible CI progress logging:
#        * Adds timestamped, flush-on-every-line log helpers so GitHub Actions
#          shows progress immediately instead of buffering output.
#        * Each queued symbol now emits a START line before yfinance is called
#          and a DONE/NO_OPTIONS/ERROR line with elapsed seconds, phase, queue
#          position, quote count, and budget progress. Universe loading and
#          index writing also log clear progress messages.
#   v7 - Reliable optionable universe fallback/merge:
#        * Adds the Cboe optionable-underlying CSV as a broad universe source.
#          If the NASDAQ screener is blocked/slow/unreachable, the fetcher now
#          still sees thousands of optionable underlyings instead of falling back
#          to the tiny built-in mega-cap seed list. When both sources work, the
#          Cboe list is used to keep the NASDAQ market-cap ordering focused on
#          symbols that actually list options, with Cboe-only names appended.
#        * Adds NASDAQ_TIMEOUT (default 20s) so a blocked NASDAQ API does not
#          stall every CI run for 45 seconds before the script can grow cache.
#   v6 - Market timezone + robust symbol-variant resolution:
#        * All "today" / working-day freshness logic now runs in a MARKET timezone
#          (TIMEZONE env, default America/New_York) instead of UTC, so "fetched
#          today" matches the actual NYSE/NASDAQ session (UTC rolls the day over
#          mid-evening in NY). `updated` is now stored with the tz offset. Set
#          TIMEZONE=UTC to restore the old behavior.
#        * fetch_ticker() now TRIES multiple symbol spellings via _symbol_variants
#          — dash / dot / slash AND the separator-stripped form (BRK-B, BRK.B,
#          BRK/B, BRKB) — returning the first that actually lists options, so a
#          wrong class-share separator can't cause a false "no options".
#   v5 - Class-share symbols + no-options skiplist + updated-file report:
#        * SYMBOL ALIASES / canonicalization (_canonical): the NASDAQ screener
#          spells class shares "BRK.B" / "BRK/B" but Yahoo/yfinance wants the DASH
#          form "BRK-B". Symbols are now canonicalized everywhere (universe, file
#          name, index key, skiplist) so BRK.B & co. actually fetch. Explicit
#          SYMBOL_ALIASES map (+ SYMBOL_ALIASES env) covers irregular cases; the
#          class-share "^"-only filter no longer drops "." / "/" tickers.
#        * NO-OPTIONS SKIPLIST (data/index.json → no_options; was scripts/no_options.json
#          before v9): a ticker that genuinely
#          returns no chain is recorded with the date checked and SKIPPED on
#          future runs (re-checked after SKIP_RECHECK_DAYS, default 30), so we
#          stop wasting the budget re-fetching dead tickers. A real network/source
#          ERROR is distinguished from "no options" (only errors count toward the
#          rate-limit streak; only true no-option results are skiplisted). A
#          symbol that later lists options is auto-removed from the skiplist.
#        * index.json no longer churns: it is rewritten ONLY when the per-ticker
#          `files` map actually changes (so `generated` isn't bumped on no-op runs).
#        * The run now PRINTS the exact list of files it wrote ("UPDATED FILES")
#          so you know precisely what to copy & replace.
#   v4 - Missing-first then oldest-first rotation, per-ticker index (see below).
#
# WHAT IT DOES (v13 — index has no timestamps/generated; v12 — Cboe 1st-order only; model greeks in UI; v10 names; v9 skiplist; v8 logged Cboe universe; v5/v4 queue + index):
#   1. Builds a UNIVERSE of optionable US underlyings. Preferred path: pull the
#      NASDAQ screener (no key), sort DESC by market cap, and keep/merge symbols
#      that appear in Cboe's optionable-underlying directory so the queue mostly
#      walks liquid optionable names first. If NASDAQ is unreachable, use the
#      broad Cboe directory directly (thousands of underlyings) instead of the
#      tiny built-in seed list. Filters NASDAQ rows to the Microcap floor
#      (>= $10M) so it walks the tiers Mega(176B+) -> Large(36B+) -> Mid(6B+) ->
#      Small(2B+) -> Micro(10M+). Falls back to the small built-in list only if
#      BOTH live universe sources fail.
#   2. Builds a WORK QUEUE in two phases (this is the v4 change — see below):
#        PHASE 1 (COVERAGE): every universe symbol that has NO cached file yet,
#          in market-cap order (Mega -> Micro). The #1 goal is to get data for
#          ALL possible tickers FIRST, resuming DOWN the list where the previous
#          run stopped — NOT re-looping the top-cap names over and over.
#        PHASE 2 (REFRESH): once nothing is missing, refresh EXISTING files that
#          are STALE (per the working-day rules), OLDEST-UPDATED FIRST, so the
#          cache rotates evenly and the least-fresh data is always updated next.
#      Files that are still FRESH today are skipped in both phases.
#   3. Fetches the full option chain via yfinance, enriches greeks from Cboe
#      delayed 1st-order quotes (model greeks left to the UI), then WRITES/OVERWRITES
#      data/{SYMBOL}.json. Stops when EITHER we hit the per-run budget
#      (MAX_FETCHES) OR the source appears to rate-limit us (a streak of
#      empty/error responses). Each run does NEW work; the next run resumes.
#   4. Rewrites data/index.json as a per-ticker manifest that records EACH
#      ticker's own `updated` timestamp (see OUTPUT SHAPE) so freshness is
#      visible without opening every file. It is regenerated from the files on
#      disk (each file's real `updated`), so unchanged tickers keep their old
#      timestamp — the manifest no longer churns a single global `updated`.
#      The same file also stores the no-options skiplist under `no_options`.
#
# FRESHNESS RULES (see _file_is_fresh): a cached file is SKIPPED when...
#   * it was updated TODAY (any day); OR
#   * TODAY is NOT a trading day (weekend/holiday) AND it was updated on the LAST
#     trading day (or later) — that's the freshest data that exists.
#   ...and it is RE-FETCHED (stale) when TODAY is a trading day (Mon-Fri, not a
#   holiday) and the file is from an earlier day. So across a week the cache ends
#   up fully refreshed, and yesterday's files get updated today.
#
# WHY THIS DESIGN:
#   - No hand-maintained ticker list (user request): the universe is discovered.
#   - COVERAGE-FIRST, then ROTATING REFRESH: the previous version re-walked the
#     universe top-down every run, so if it never got past the mega-caps it kept
#     re-fetching the SAME first tickers and never reached the rest. v4 fixes that
#     by doing all MISSING tickers first (so every ticker eventually gets cached),
#     then cycling the OLDEST existing files so refreshes spread across the whole
#     cache instead of piling on the top names.
#   - Idempotent + resumable: safe to run many times/day from GitHub Actions.
#
# OUTPUT SHAPE (matches the "Static cache" provider in main.tsx):
#   data/index.json        -> { "files": ["<TICKER>", ...],
#                               "count": N,
#                               "names": { "<TICKER>": "Company Name", ... },
#                               "no_options": { "<TICKER>": "YYYY-MM-DD", ... } }
#                             (v13: `files` is a sorted ticker LIST — no per-ticker
#                             timestamps and no global `generated`. Freshness uses
#                             data/{TICKER}.json mtime (+ in-file `updated` for the
#                             weekend dead-zone rule). Legacy map shape still read.
#                             v9: `no_options` skiplist. v10: `names` for suggestions.)

#   data/{TICKER}.json     -> { symbol, updated (ISO), underlyingPrice,
#                               greeks{...}, expirations[], quotes[] }
#                             quotes keep bid/ask/last/volume/OI/IV from yfinance,
#                             then fill delta/gamma/theta/vega/rho from Cboe delayed
#                             data when available. Model / higher-order greeks are
#                             NOT computed here — the UI (src/main.tsx) does that
#                             at runtime for ALL providers including CACHE.
#                             Per-quote `greeksSource` is `cboe` or null;
#                             `greeksMissingReason` explains remaining gaps.
