 * 2. AGENT READ-WRITE RULE: If a future deployment or agent updates the code,
 *    this header section and related documentation blocks MUST be kept accurate
 *    and synchronized with feature upgrades.
 * 3. SINGLE-FILE CONTINUITY: Keep the core APP architecture self-contained in
 *    this file. (Optional INFRASTRUCTURE lives outside the 3 source files — see
 *    "COMPANION INFRASTRUCTURE" below — and is not required for the app to run.)

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CHANGELOG (append newest at top; keep history accurate):
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * v0.9.40 - Strike column containment fix:
 *          - Strike ($) track was too narrow for high-priced underlyings
 *            (e.g. MPWR ~$1,344 → strikes like `1,480.00`). With default
 *            OI/Vol/IV/Greeks + Bid/Mid/Ask on both sides, the center track
 *            compressed so strike text spilled past its cell into Put Bid.
 *          - Widened Strike track to `minmax(5.75rem, 1.15fr)`, bumped the
 *            desk min-width strike allowance (4.5 → 6.25 rem), tightened strike
 *            cell padding (`px-1.5`), and added CSS containment on
 *            `.od-strike-cell` (`min-width: 0`, `overflow: hidden`,
 *            `text-overflow: ellipsis`, `white-space: nowrap`) so the value
 *            stays INSIDE the Strike column at every viewport width. Full value
 *            remains available via the cell `title` tooltip if clipped.
 * v0.9.39 - Option desk spacing, flag & i18n updates:
 *          - Spacing: widened Strike ($) column (`minmax(4.25rem, 1.05fr)`) and
 *            added scalable `--od-cgap: 0.25rem` (`column-gap: var(--od-cgap)`)
 *            between grid tracks so Strike ($) and Put Bid (plus all desk columns)
 *            stay clearly separated and scale smoothly without clashing.
 *            Added `headerLabel` support (`OI`, `IV`, `Vol`, `Δ`, `Γ`...) and
 *            tooltip (`title`) to column headers (`.od-labels`).
 *          - Language flag: use US flag (`🇺🇸`) instead of GB (`🇬🇧`) for `en`.
 *          - i18n(en/ru): updated `settings.deskColumns.openInterest` (`Open interest (OI)`
 *            / `Открытый интерес (OI)`) and `iv` (`Implied volatility (IV)` /
 *            `Подразумеваемая волатильность (IV)`). Translated Greek names into
 *            standard Russian Cyrillic spelling (`Дельта Δ`, `Гамма Γ`, `Тета Θ`,
 *            `Вега`, `Ро ρ`, `Лямбда λ`, `Ванна`, `Вомма`, `Чарм`, `Спид`, `Зомма`,
 *            `Колор`) for Settings with short `headerLabel`s for chain table.
 * v0.9.38 - i18n(ru): translate the option-chain section headers that were
 *          left in English under Russian locale — chain.calls/puts/strike now
 *          render Коллы / Путы / Страйк (previously hard-coded "Calls/Puts/Strike"
 *          in the RU dictionary). Settings deskColumns labels + the "(no options)"
 *          ticker badge translated too. Greek-letter / IV / API labels stay in
 *          Latin by design (standard in Russian options terminology).
 * v0.9.37 - i18n consolidation & fixes (PR #21):
 *          - Inlined src/i18n.tsx into this file (single-file continuity);
 *            src/ now holds only main.tsx, index.html, index.css, favicon.ico.
 *          - Fixed literal {{expirations}} / {{load}} in the empty-state hints:
 *            the two templated sentences are now fragment keys with the button
 *            label rendered as a styled inline span (no unsubstituted placeholders).
 *          - Language switcher now shows distinct ru/en flag icons (🇬🇧/🇷🇺)
 *            instead of a single shared 🌐 globe for both languages.
 * v0.9.36 - Rename primary action button label Get dates → Expirations
 *          (loading: Loading…). Internal getDates() name unchanged.
 * v0.9.35 - After confirming a ticker (suggestion click, or Enter in the
 *          input), focus jumps to the Expirations button so Space/Enter runs
 *          the fetch without a mouse trip (mirrors Load-button focus UX).
 * v0.9.34 - Ticker input selects all text on focus/click so typing a new
 *          symbol replaces the previous ticker without manual clear.
 * v0.9.33 - Single source of truth for model greeks (UI only):
 *          - scripts/fetch_data.py no longer runs Black-Scholes / higher-order
 *            math; it only attaches Cboe delayed 1st-order when available.
 *          - λ + 2nd/3rd-order + full BS fallback remain exclusively in this
 *            file (blackScholesGreeks / enrichQuotesWithModelGreeks) so live
 *            and CACHE providers share one implementation without duplication.
 * v0.9.32 - Providers trimmed to CACHE + CBOE + NASDAQ + YAHOO:
 *          - Removed marketdata.app and DoltHub from the live registry.
 *          - Short uppercase labels; fixed dropdown order: CACHE, CBOE, NASDAQ, YAHOO.
 *          - Default selection only (not order): CBOE on localhost/LAN; CACHE on Pages.
 *          - Settings migration: unknown/removed providerId resets to host default.
 * v0.9.31 - Client-side Black-Scholes greeks enrichment for live providers:
 *          - Higher-order greeks (λ, vanna, vomma, charm, speed, zomma, color)
 *            used to exist only on Static cache because scripts/fetch_data.py
 *            pre-computed them at build time. Live providers (CBOE/Yahoo/
 *            NASDAQ) now get the same model enrichment in the browser after
 *            fetch, using spot + IV + strike + side + expiration.
 *          - Provider-supplied 1st-order greeks (e.g. CBOE delta/gamma) are kept;
 *            only missing fields are filled. Full model set is used when the
 *            provider has IV but no greeks (Yahoo). NASDAQ still has no IV, so
 *            model greeks remain empty there.
 *          - Enrichment runs in putBulk / loadExpiration so desk columns work
 *            uniformly across providers without changing proxy APIs.
 * v0.9.30 - Static-cache higher-order greeks parse fix:
 *          - Static provider now maps lambda + 2nd/3rd-order greeks
 *            (vanna/vomma/charm/speed/zomma/color) exactly once (no duplicate
 *            object keys). OptionQuote types document these optional fields.
 *          - Desk column renderers read typed fields instead of `as any`.
 * v0.9.29 - Desk columns + compact theme picker:
 *          - Options desk columns are now user-configurable in Settings. OI,
 *            Volume, IV and Greeks can be toggled; Bid/Mid/Ask and Strike stay
 *            visible so the desk remains readable. Greeks are enabled by
 *            default and render delta/gamma/theta/vega when available.
 *          - Missing quote data now renders as an empty cell instead of a dash.
 *          - Theme switch is now a compact current-theme icon with an animated
 *            dropdown of the other themes; Escape/click-away closes it.
 * v0.9.28 - Static-cache greeks metadata:
 *          - OptionQuote now carries optional `greeksSource` and
 *            `greeksMissingReason` fields, and ChainMeta/ChainResult can carry a
 *            top-level `greeks` enrichment summary from data/{TICKER}.json.
 *          - Static-cache parsing preserves these fields so future greeks-based
 *            analytics can distinguish provider-supplied Cboe delayed greeks
 *            from Black-Scholes model estimates.
 * v0.9.27 - Local-index company names in ticker suggestions:
 *          - data/index.json may now include `names: { TICKER: companyName }`.
 *            The local fallback suggestion source reads that map, displays the
 *            company/fund/index name instead of the generic "Ticker from local
 *            index", and also searches names so typing "apple" can suggest AAPL.
 *          - Existing no-options labeling is preserved: a named no-options row
 *            still shows the symbol with "(no options)" while using the stored
 *            company name as the description.
 * v0.9.26 - Provider-aware ticker suggestions + local no-options fallback:
 *          - Replaced the Static-cache-only ticker <select> with a searchable
 *            combobox input for ALL providers. Suggestions are fetched while the
 *            user types and can be picked without auto-loading; Enter still runs
 *            Get dates unless a highlighted suggestion is selected.
 *          - Providers with a native searchable universe now use it: Yahoo,
 *            NASDAQ and CBOE call the companion proxy's new unified
 *            /api/search?provider=<id>&q=... endpoint; DoltHub uses SQL against
 *            option_chain at DOLT_LATEST_DATE. Providers without such an endpoint
 *            fall back to data/index.json.
 *          - data/index.json fallback now reads BOTH `files` (cached tickers with
 *            options) and `no_options` (valid tickers where the latest scan found
 *            no listed options). no_options rows are visibly labeled
 *            "(no options)" in the suggestion menu and Static fetches now produce
 *            an explicit no-options message instead of a misleading 404.
 * v0.9.25 - FOCUS-ON-CLICK for multi-expiration desks (BDD requested):
 *          - GIVEN 4 expirations loaded and scrolled to the latest (4th),
 *            WHEN user clicks any date bar above (2nd or 3rd) in the sticky pile,
 *            THEN: (1) the CURRENT active expiration (e.g. 4th, the one in view)
 *            is collapsed — chevron flips v -> > — (2) the CLICKED expiration is
 *            expanded (if it was collapsed) and becomes the ONLY expanded one
 *            when many (>1) were expanded (smart exclusive mode per user choice),
 *            otherwise just swaps active <-> clicked, (3) view scrolls to the
 *            vertical middle where the ATM strike is (centerStrike, accounts for
 *            the sticky pile). If the clicked bar is ALREADY expanded, it still
 *            collapses the current active and scrolls to its ATM (scroll-and-
 *            collapse). Clicking the active bar itself still toggles collapse.
 *          - Implementation: rewritten toggleOne() in ChainTable to detect
 *            activeExp vs clicked exp, compute expandedCount, perform exclusive
 *            collapse when >1 expanded, else swap, then centerStrike().
 * v0.9.24 - REMOVE the scroll-driven auto collapse/expand feature entirely (user
 *          request). Collapse/expand is now PURELY MANUAL: per-section header
 *          click and Expand all / Collapse all. Deleted: the `autoMode` state,
 *          `recomputeAuto`, the anchoring useLayoutEffect, and all its refs
 *          (collapsedRef, lastScrollTop, suppressAuto, expandUpIdx,
 *          pendingAnchor); the scroll listener now only tracks the active section
 *          for header highlighting. A fresh Load still resets to fully expanded,
 *          and loading / manually expanding a section still centers its current
 *          strike (centerStrike, unchanged). Removed the now-unused
 *          useLayoutEffect import.
 * v0.9.23 - Fix two expand bugs (both rooted in centerStrike timing):
 *          - BUG: clicking a COLLAPSED header while scrolled down only flipped
 *            the chevron; the section didn't appear. ROOT CAUSE: centerStrike ran
 *            a ONE-SHOT requestAnimationFrame, but an expanding section mounts its
 *            rows a couple of renders later (the `rendered` state flips in an
 *            effect, then staggered rows paint). The rAF found no ATM row and
 *            bailed, so the (now-rendered) desk was never scrolled into view — it
 *            sat above the fold. FIX: centerStrike now RETRIES across frames until
 *            the ATM row exists (and nudges again until the scroll delta is ~0),
 *            so expand reliably lands on the strike whether the section was
 *            already open or just opening.
 *          - BUG: scrolling back UP re-expanded upper sections at the BEGINNING
 *            of their data (and with no visible animation, since it happened off
 *            screen). FIX: the auto UP-expand branch now CENTERS the re-expanded
 *            section on its current strike (via centerStrike) instead of merely
 *            anchoring its bar — symmetric with load / manual-click behavior. A
 *            `suppressAuto` guard stops that programmatic scroll from being read
 *            as a user "scroll down" and re-collapsing what we just opened.
 * v0.9.22 - AUTO scroll-driven collapse/expand for multi-expiration chains:
 *          - When multiple expirations are loaded, scrolling DOWN now auto-
 *            collapses each earlier section once you've fully scrolled past it
 *            (only its pinned header bar remains in the top pile); scrolling UP
 *            auto-expands them again. The collapsed set is always a PREFIX
 *            [0..k-1]; the LAST section never auto-collapses. View is ANCHORED
 *            across each prefix change so the scrollbar doesn't jump; the UP
 *            expand triggers when scrollTop reaches the top with a collapsed
 *            prefix, restoring that section's height so you can keep scrolling up.
 *          - AUTO-MODE lifecycle (per user spec): ON by default right after a
 *            Load (new symbol OR a different set of loaded expirations resets it
 *            to fully-expanded + auto ON). It turns OFF — and stays off until the
 *            next Load — the moment the user takes ANY manual collapse action:
 *            clicking a single header (toggleOne) OR Expand all / Collapse all
 *            (toggleAll). So manual layout is never fought by the scroll logic.
 *          - Clicking a collapsed header still expands it AND jumps to that
 *            section's current (ATM) strike (centerStrike), satisfying "expand →
 *            land on the money, not the top of the data".
 * v0.9.21 - Harden the estimateSpot() TS2802 fix: use Map.prototype.forEach
 *          instead of iterating the Map. v0.9.19 switched to
 *          `Array.from(byStrike.entries())`, but Array.from over a Map iterator
 *          can STILL trip TS2802 under some low-`target` tsconfigs (it consumes
 *          the iteration protocol). `forEach` is a plain method call with no
 *          iteration protocol, so it type-checks under ANY target/downlevel
 *          setting. Re-verified tsc rc=0 at ES5 (downlevelIteration:false) and
 *          ES2020. (If your IDE still shows the error, re-copy main.tsx — the
 *          fix must be present at the `byStrike.forEach(...)` line.)
 * v0.9.20 - Static cache: replace the vague "Bad static data" with ACTIONABLE
 *          diagnostics. The old code did `await res.json().catch(() => null)`,
 *          which swallowed the real cause. Root cause in the wild: a dev/preview
 *          or SPA host serving index.html (200 HTML) for a missing data/*.json
 *          instead of a 404 — so res.json() throws and the message was useless
 *          (and the ticker <select> also went blank because index.json failed
 *          the same way). New fetchStaticJson() reads the body as TEXT first and
 *          distinguishes: network error / 404 (not cached) / HTML SPA fallback /
 *          malformed-or-truncated JSON (NaN/Infinity), each with a fix hint.
 *          listTickers() and fetchAll() both use it.
 * v0.9.19 - Fix TS2802 in estimateSpot(): iterating a Map with `for...of`
 *          requires a tsconfig `target` of ES2015+ (or `downlevelIteration`).
 *          Some consuming projects use a lower target, so the direct
 *          `for (const [k, v] of map)` errored in their IDE. Switched to
 *          `Array.from(byStrike.entries())`, which type-checks under ANY target.
 *          (All other Map/Set usages already used Array.from(...) / .has(), so
 *          this was the only offending spot. Verified tsc rc=0 at both ES5 with
 *          downlevelIteration:false and ES2020.)
 * v0.9.18 - Collapse now stays IN VIEW when scrolled down:
 *          - BUG: collapsing a section that was NOT the last expanded one, while
 *            scrolled partway down, flipped its chevron but the section seemed to
 *            vanish. ROOT CAUSE: removing its rows shrank the content below the
 *            fold, so the browser CLAMPED scrollTop and the view jumped, carrying
 *            the just-collapsed bar off-screen. (Collapsing only the LAST expanded
 *            section removes nothing below it, so it appeared to "work fine".)
 *          - FIX: after the close animation settles (~200ms), scrollBarToPinned()
 *            smooth-scrolls the collapsed bar to its pinned slot in the top pile,
 *            so you always see it squashed with the next section right below.
 *            Expanding still centers the current strike (unchanged). Uses
 *            bar.offsetTop against the now `position: relative` scroll container.
 * v0.9.17 - Sticky expiration-bar PILE fix (the "hole" bug):
 *          - ROOT CAUSE: each sticky .od-bar lived inside its own .od-sec block
 *            wrapper, which became the bar's CONTAINING BLOCK and CLIPPED it to
 *            that section's bounds. So when a section scrolled off the top, its
 *            bar left WITH it instead of accumulating in the top pile — leaving a
 *            gap where the previous section's last rows showed through above the
 *            current bar (and multiple date bars failed to stack). FIX: .od-sec is
 *            now `display: contents` (see index.css) so it generates no box; every
 *            bar's containing block becomes the whole .od-desk and the bars
 *            correctly PILE UP as you scroll (earlier expirations stay pinned as
 *            thin collapsed bars above the expanded one).
 *          - Because .od-sec now has no box, the measurement ref moved from the
 *            wrapper onto the sticky BAR element (barRefs), and active-section
 *            tracking was rewritten to find the LAST bar that has reached its
 *            pinned slot (the section whose content is on screen below the pile).
 * v0.9.16 - Always-expanded-on-load + center-strike + per-ticker static index:
 *          - Collapse/expand state is NO LONGER persisted to localStorage
 *            (removed COLLAPSE_KEY / loadCollapsed / saveCollapsed). A freshly
 *            loaded chain ALWAYS starts fully EXPANDED — there is no longer any
 *            case where a stale saved state makes a just-loaded chain appear
 *            collapsed. Collapse is now purely session-ephemeral; switching
 *            symbol resets it to expanded.
 *          - CENTER-STRIKE view: the current (ATM) strike is scrolled to the
 *            vertical middle of the desk (a) right after data loads / the loaded
 *            expiration set changes, and (b) whenever a section is EXPANDED. New
 *            `atmRef` on ExpirationSection registers the ATM row; ChainTable's
 *            centerStrike() accounts for the sticky expiration-bar pile so the
 *            strike lands in the visible center, not under the pinned headers.
 *          - Static-cache provider reads the NEW data/index.json shape:
 *            `{ files: { TICKER: updatedISO }, count, generated }` (per-ticker
 *            timestamps). listTickers() now derives the list from sorted keys of
 *            `files`. No backward-compat with the old `{ tickers, updated }`.
 *            (INFRA fetch_data.py v4: coverage-first (all MISSING tickers, resume
 *            down the cap-ranked list) then rotating REFRESH of the OLDEST files,
 *            so every ticker gets cached before we re-loop — and we never re-loop
 *            only the top-cap names. index.json rebuilt from each file's own
 *            `updated`, so it no longer churns a single global timestamp.)
 * v0.9.15 - DROP the <table>; render the desk as DIV/CSS-GRID rows. Native table
 *          sticky <th> backgrounds go transparent while scrolling in WebKit/Blink
 *          (the persistent "headers see-through on scroll" bug) — no CSS override
 *          reliably fixes it. Switched to block/grid elements (same approach as
 *          the sibling daggerok/csv project) where sticky works flawlessly:
 *          .od-desk > .od-sec > (.od-bar sticky-accumulating + .od-sub sticky-
 *          when-active + .od-drow grid rows). Columns share one grid template
 *          (--od-grid). All prior features preserved: stacking pile, active
 *          highlight (click + scroll), collapse/expand animation, strike-count,
 *          center Strike guide, full-width + adaptive height.
 *          (INFRA, fetch_data.py v3: working-day freshness — skip today's data
 *          and last-trading-day data on weekends/holidays, re-fetch older files
 *          on trading days; universe deepened to the full US Micro+ cap tiers.)
 * v0.9.14 - Sticky sub-headers STILL see-through on scroll -> forced fix: the
 *          CSS `.table-container table { border-collapse: separate }` was being
 *          overridden by Tailwind Preflight's `table { border-collapse: collapse }`.
 *          Now set border-collapse:separate + border-spacing:0 as an INLINE style
 *          on the <table> (guaranteed to win the cascade), so sticky <th>
 *          backgrounds stay opaque while scrolling.
 * v0.9.13 - Sticky sub-headers no longer see-through on scroll: the desk table
 *          switched from `border-collapse` to `border-collapse: separate` (see
 *          index.css). Collapsed-border tables make WebKit/Blink paint sticky
 *          <th> backgrounds transparent while scrolling; `separate` fixes it so
 *          the Calls|Strike|Puts + column-label rows stay opaque over the rows.
 * v0.9.10 - Real fix for active-highlight-on-click + center Strike guide:
 *          - ROOT CAUSE of the persistent bug: the scroll-tracking effect had
 *            `collapsed` in its deps, so every collapse/expand re-ran
 *            recomputeActive() and instantly overwrote the clicked highlight back
 *            to the top section. Now recomputeActive runs ONLY on real scroll/
 *            resize (deps: [recomputeActive]); toggleOne sets the clicked header
 *            active; a separate effect seeds the initial highlight from the first
 *            section on load. So the highlight follows what you actually click.
 *          - Added a subtle vertical CENTER "Strike" column guide (index.css) so
 *            the eye tracks the middle axis quickly in long chains.
 * v0.9.9 - Active-highlight-on-click fix + even/comfortable columns:
 *          - BUG FIX: `activeExp` (the highlighted header) was purely scroll-
 *            based, so collapsing a LOWER section left the highlight on the top
 *            one. toggleOne() now sets activeExp to the CLICKED expiration; a
 *            later scroll recomputes it normally. Moved the activeExp state up so
 *            toggleOne can reference it.
 *          - COLUMNS: table-layout:fixed + an explicit <colgroup> (6 call cols,
 *            a narrower Strike col, 6 put cols) so columns are EQUAL and stretch
 *            evenly to fill wide screens; a table min-width (index.css) keeps
 *            them comfortable and horizontally scrollable on small screens.
 * v0.9.8 - Full-width desk, adaptive height, controls placement:
 *          - Removed the 2xl width cap on the table (it was centering/capping the
 *            desk while the controls stayed full-width, which both misaligned the
 *            Collapse-all button AND stopped the table from filling). The desk is
 *            now genuinely FULL WIDTH (w-full) and its controls align with it.
 *          - ADAPTIVE HEIGHT: max-h switched to calc(100dvh - 210px) so tall
 *            screens fit more strikes without scrolling (dvh accounts for mobile
 *            browser chrome; smaller offset reclaims vertical space).
 *          - Controls confirmed ABOVE the desk, full width: "N expirations" on
 *            the LEFT, Collapse-all / Expand-all on the RIGHT.
 * v0.9.7 - Whole-header toggle, symmetric collapse animation, ultra-wide cap:
 *          - The ENTIRE expiration bar (chevron + date + strike count) is now a
 *            SINGLE toggle button: clicking anywhere on it collapses/expands that
 *            expiration, and clicking again does the opposite (fixes the bug
 *            where a second click on a collapsed header didn't re-collapse).
 *            Removed the separate "click date to scroll/jump" action and its
 *            arrival-flash (superseded; od-flash/flash-bar no longer used) so the
 *            behavior is uniform across the whole header.
 *          - COLLAPSE is now ANIMATED symmetrically to expand: rows stay mounted
 *            briefly and FADE OUT (od-row-out) before unmounting, mirroring the
 *            open fade-in. New local rendered/closing state drives this.
 *          - ULTRA-WIDE cap: the desk stays full-width on laptops/normal screens
 *            but is capped (2xl:max-w-[1600px], centered) so numeric columns
 *            don't stretch uncomfortably across very large monitors/TVs.
 * v0.9.6 - Header centering fix, uniform style, wide layout, arrival flash:
 *          - BUG FIX: when all sections were collapsed the header content
 *            left-aligned (the colSpan 6|1|6 grid had no body rows to size it).
 *            The expiration bar is now a SINGLE centered colSpan=13 cell, so it
 *            looks & sits IDENTICALLY collapsed or expanded — only the chevron
 *            changes (v / >). Format is now uniform "YYYY-MM-DD  N strikes"
 *            (single space, no "|" divider, no "Expiration" word, no parens).
 *          - WIDE LAYOUT on big screens: <main> is a centered max-w-3xl column on
 *            phones/tablets but goes FULL WIDTH at lg+ (laptops/desktops/TVs) via
 *            lg:max-w-none + responsive padding, so the desk uses all the space.
 *            Mobile/tablet keep the readable narrow column (no zoom-out there).
 *          - ARRIVAL FLASH: jumping to an expiration briefly flashes its bar
 *            (od-flash / flash-bar keyframe, ~1.1s) so the eye catches the landing.
 * v0.9.5 - Active-section highlight, expand-on-date-click, header re-layout:
 *          - The in-view expiration bar gets an `.od-current` highlight (brighter
 *            tint + left indigo accent) so you can see where you are in the pile.
 *          - Clicking the DATE now EXPANDS a collapsed section (animated via the
 *            od-row-in group/label rows); when already expanded it scrolls to it.
 *            The chevron still always toggles collapse.
 *          - Header re-laid out to mirror the columns: [chevron DATE] | [N
 *            strikes], where "|" sits over the Strike column. Removed the word
 *            "Expiration" (all rows are expirations) and the parentheses.
 * v0.9.4 - Clickable pile headers (jump-to-expiration):
 *          - The expiration bar now has TWO targets: the chevron toggles
 *            collapse (as before); clicking the DATE text calls scrollToSection()
 *            which smooth-scrolls the desk so that expiration lands right below
 *            the pinned pile of earlier bars (offset = index * --od-bar). So you
 *            can tap any accumulated header in the top pile to jump to it.
 * v0.9.3 - Staggered rows, live cache stats, stacking sticky headers:
 *          - Staggered fade-in for option rows (od-row-in), CAPPED to the first
 *            STAGGER_ROWS (15) so huge chains (SPY ~13k rows) don't flicker.
 *          - LIVE cache stats: added a cache pub/sub (subscribeCache /
 *            notifyCacheChanged) fired on every store/evict/clear, so Settings →
 *            Cache updates immediately (fixes "stats didn't recalc after Clear").
 *          - NOTE on size (answering a question): SPY genuinely has ~13,690
 *            contracts across ~35 expirations (~3 MB normalized). Because CBOE is
 *            BULK, one "Get dates" caches the WHOLE chain -> that's the 3.03 MB;
 *            not a bug. localStorage ~5 MB, so LRU eviction keeps ~1-2 big
 *            symbols; rounding floats saved only ~1% so it's real data volume.
 *          - STACKING STICKY HEADERS (#4): the desk is now ONE <table> with one
 *            <tbody class="od-sec"> per expiration. Each Expiration bar is
 *            sticky and ACCUMULATES into a pile at the top as you scroll down
 *            (un-piles scrolling up). A scroll tracker marks the in-view section
 *            `.od-active` so only its Calls|Strike|Puts + column labels pin below
 *            the pile; passed sections show just their bar (like collapsed). Per
 *            section index is passed as CSS var --i (see index.css geometry).
 * v0.9.2 - Collapse persistence, always-on strike count, motion polish, UX:
 *          - Collapsed/expanded state per expiration now PERSISTS in
 *            localStorage (COLLAPSE_KEY), keyed by symbol, and re-hydrates on
 *            reload / when switching tickers (loadCollapsed/saveCollapsed).
 *          - The "(N strikes)" count in each expiration header is now shown
 *            ALWAYS (both collapsed and expanded), not only when collapsed.
 *          - MOTION POLISH (index.css): app-wide quick transitions on buttons/
 *            inputs/links, subtle active-press feedback, an accordion "expand"
 *            animation for a section's body, and a prefers-reduced-motion guard.
 *          - Ticker text input and the Static-cache ticker <select> now share
 *            the SAME fixed width (w-44) for a consistent, easy click target.
 *          - After picking an expiration chip, focus jumps to the Load button
 *            (via loadBtnRef) and the selector is a <form>, so pressing Enter
 *            loads immediately without clicking Load.
 * v0.9.1 - Sticky-header opacity fix + centered expiration + collapse feature:
 *          - BUG: dark-mode sticky header used semi-transparent rgba tints
 *            (alpha 0.4/0.6) so scrolled body rows bled through. All header
 *            backgrounds (neutral, Calls/Puts group tints, and the Expiration
 *            row) are now FULLY OPAQUE in both light & dark (index.css).
 *          - BUG: the Expiration row was left-aligned; it is now CENTERED in the
 *            full-width top sticky row.
 *          - FEATURE: each expiration section can be COLLAPSED/expanded (click
 *            its centered header row; a chevron shows state and, when collapsed,
 *            a "(N strikes)" hint). Added a Collapse-all / Expand-all toggle
 *            above the desk. Collapsed sections hide rows 2-3 + body.
 * v0.9.0 - Cache management UI (Settings) + synced infra edits:
 *          - Settings → Cache panel shows live STATS: number of cached data
 *            records, data bytes used vs CACHE_MAX_BYTES (with a usage bar),
 *            settings blob size, and oldest/newest record timestamps.
 *          - THREE clear actions (each two-click confirm):
 *              * Clear data     -> removes only queried-data cache (keeps settings)
 *              * Clear settings -> removes only persisted settings (keeps data),
 *                                  and resets in-memory settings to defaults
 *              * Clear everything -> wipes all "options-desk.*" localStorage keys
 *            Implemented via cacheStats(), clearCacheData(), clearSettingsStore(),
 *            clearAll(); also clears the in-memory bulkCache where relevant.
 *          - Synced user infra edits: proxy startup log columns aligned to
 *            "Yahoo | / CBOE | / NASDAQ |"; GitHub Action switched to uv +
 *            actions/checkout@v7 + astral-sh/setup-uv with an 8-slot weekday
 *            cron and REQUEST_SLEEP=1.
 *          - NOTE (answering a question): CBOE/NASDAQ/marketdata are BULK — one
 *            "Get dates" request downloads the whole chain (all expirations) and
 *            caches it, so "Load" filters from cache with NO extra network call
 *            (hence no proxy log). Lazy providers (Yahoo/DoltHub) DO log on the
 *            first Load of each expiration, then serve from cache.
 * v0.8.0 - Multi-expiration desk, sticky 3-row header, persistent cache,
 *          local-first ordering, NASDAQ provider, proxy request logging:
 *          - MULTI-EXPIRATION: pick one or MANY expirations (checkbox chips +
 *            All/None); they render stacked EARLIEST→LATEST, each as its own
 *            table section. State moved from a single `selectedExp`/`expQuotes`
 *            to `selectedExps[]` + `expData{exp:quotes}`; loadChain fetches all
 *            selected (bulk = one cached call, lazy = per-exp cached).
 *          - STICKY HEADER FIX: the header is now THREE stacked, non-overlapping
 *            sticky rows — [Expiration] / [Calls|Strike|Puts] / [column labels]
 *            — via fixed-height rows and per-row `top` offsets in index.css
 *            (.od-hrow-1/2/3). Previously both rows used top:0 and clashed.
 *          - PERSISTENT QUERY CACHE (localStorage) with SIZE-AWARE LRU eviction:
 *            every successful query is stored; before writing we evict the
 *            OLDEST records until it fits under CACHE_MAX_BYTES, and on
 *            QuotaExceededError we drop-oldest-and-retry. Survives reloads.
 *          - LOCAL-FIRST ORDERING: on localhost / 127.x / 0.0.0.0 / LAN the
 *            provider list is REVERSED (CBOE, NASDAQ, Yahoo first — you have the
 *            proxy running); on hosted (GitHub Pages) the no-setup order stays.
 *          - NEW PROVIDER "NASDAQ" (proxy, no key): full chain (all expirations)
 *            in one call; parses OCC ids from drillDownURL; spot from lastTrade.
 *          - PROXY LOGGING: the Bun proxy & Worker now log each relay as
 *            "$proxy | $localPath -> $remoteUrl" with a fixed-width proxy column
 *            (CBOE/YAHOO/NASDAQ). Added /api/nasdaq to both proxies.
 * v0.7.0 - Trim to privacy-friendly providers + fix DoltHub + CBOE local proxy:
 *          - REMOVED providers that need an account with sensitive sign-up or a
 *            paid/gated plan (per user request & live re-testing):
 *              * Tradier, Alpaca  -> require brokerage-style sign-up (SSN/ID).
 *              * Polygon/Massive  -> options snapshot NOT in the free plan
 *                (confirmed: "plan lacks the options snapshot").
 *              * Alpha Vantage    -> HISTORICAL_OPTIONS is now premium-gated; the
 *                free key returns the 25/day limit on the FIRST call, so it is
 *                effectively unusable for options. Dropped.
 *          - REMAINING providers (works-first, all no-account or same-origin):
 *            marketdata (AAPL keyless), Static cache, DoltHub, Yahoo(proxy),
 *            CBOE(proxy).
 *          - FIXED DoltHub "hangs then network error": the correlated
 *            `MAX(date)` subquery scanned the 5.63GB DB and timed out (>25s).
 *            Verified the archive is frozen at 2024-11-11, so we now HARDCODE
 *            DOLT_LATEST_DATE and filter by the indexed date -> <1s responses.
 *            Added sqlLit() to escape SQL string literals.
 *          - CBOE can now use a REQUEST-HANDLING PROXY BASE ({base}/api/cboe),
 *            same pattern as Yahoo — so the local Bun server / Worker relays it.
 *            Falls back to the generic CORS-proxy template if no base is set.
 * v0.6.0 - Added Polygon/Massive + DoltHub providers (investigated on request):
 *          - Polygon.io (rebranded Massive.com on 2025-10-30; api.polygon.io
 *            still works) [BULK, free key]. Endpoint
 *            /v3/snapshot/options/{TICKER}?limit=250&apiKey=KEY (paginated via
 *            next_url). Free "Options Basic": 5 req/min, 15-min delayed, no card.
 *            Returns greeks/IV/OI + underlying price + full contract details, so
 *            no OCC parsing needed. apiKey passed as QUERY PARAM to avoid a CORS
 *            preflight. next_url carries a cursor but not the key -> we re-append.
 *          - DoltHub dolthub/options [LAZY, no key]. SQL-over-HTTP:
 *            GET /api/v1alpha1/dolthub/options/master?q=<SQL>. Verified live: the
 *            option_chain table has date/expiration/strike/call_put/bid/ask/vol/
 *            delta/gamma/theta/vega/rho (NO volume/OI, NO spot -> parity est.).
 *            IMPORTANT: it is a FROZEN HISTORICAL ARCHIVE (last date ≈2024-11-11),
 *            excellent for research/backtesting but NOT live. Honors the CBOE
 *            proxy template ({url}) so a Worker /raw can bypass any CORS block.
 *          - PROVIDERS reordered works-first with the two additions:
 *            marketdata, static, dolthub, yahoo, tradier, alpaca, polygon,
 *            alphavantage, cboe.
 * v0.5.0 - Alpaca provider (KEY + SECRET, both in localStorage):
 *          - Added the Alpaca Market Data provider (BULK). Endpoint
 *            data.alpaca.markets/v1beta1/options/snapshots/{SYMBOL}
 *            ?feed=indicative&limit=1000 (paginated via next_page_token, capped).
 *          - Verified live vs a github.io origin: CORS:* on GET AND preflight,
 *            with the two auth headers (APCA-API-KEY-ID / APCA-API-SECRET-KEY)
 *            explicitly allow-listed => works directly from a static site.
 *          - GENERALIZED CREDENTIALS: providers may now require a KEY + SECRET
 *            pair (supportsSecret/keyLabel/secretLabel). Both are persisted per
 *            provider in localStorage (settings.secrets), exactly like the single
 *            token — no backend needed for a personal static app (user's call).
 *          - Settings + onboarding render a second (secret) field when required;
 *            the "Key set" badge now requires BOTH parts for secret providers.
 *          - Free Alpaca "Basic" plan needs feed=indicative (OPRA real-time is
 *            paid, returns 403). Greeks/IV inline; OTM/0DTE may omit greeks; no
 *            spot -> UI estimates via put-call parity.
 *          - getDates() gained a credsOverride param so onboarding can retry with
 *            just-entered creds without waiting for the settings state to commit.
 * v0.4.0 - "Works-first" defaults, deferred loading, cancel, +2 providers:
 *          - DEFAULT is now marketdata.app (AAPL loads with ZERO setup — the
 *            one thing confirmed working out of the box). Providers are ordered
 *            works-first: no-setup → key-required → proxy-required.
 *          - DEFERRED LOADING (no wasted quota on page open): the app no longer
 *            auto-fetches. Flow is explicit and two-step:
 *              1) type a ticker → "Get dates" loads ONLY expirations (+spot),
 *              2) pick an expiration → "Load" fetches that expiration's chain.
 *            For BULK providers the single "Get dates" request already contains
 *            every expiration (cached); "Load"/expiration-switch is then free.
 *          - CANCEL BUTTON: every request is abortable via AbortController; a
 *            visible Cancel appears while loading, so you can bail and switch
 *            provider/ticker. Aborts are shown as a calm notice, not an error.
 *          - NEW PROVIDER "Static cache (data.json)" [BULK, no setup]: reads the
 *            site's OWN ./data/{TICKER}.json (produced by the GitHub Action +
 *            scripts/fetch_data.py, yfinance). 100% CORS-free on GitHub Pages,
 *            no keys. Ships with a ticker picker sourced from ./data/index.json.
 *          - NEW PROVIDER "Yahoo (via proxy)" [LAZY, needs proxy base]: calls a
 *            small proxy that handles Yahoo's crumb/cookie flow — either the
 *            local Bun server (scripts/yahoo-proxy.ts, default
 *            http://localhost:8787) or a deployed Cloudflare Worker
 *            (scripts/cloudflare-worker.js). Endpoint:
 *            GET {base}/api/options?symbol=X[&date=YYYY-MM-DD].
 *          - Settings gained a "Proxy base URL" field (for Yahoo/worker) and the
 *            existing CBOE CORS-proxy dropdown now also accepts a custom Worker
 *            "/raw?url={url}" template.
 *          - RESEARCH refresh (verified live vs a github.io origin): Finnhub's
 *            /stock/option-chain is now PREMIUM-only (free tier lost it). Alpaca
 *            options have CORS:* but require two keys (id+secret) => browser-
 *            unsafe for a public static site; noted for the Worker path instead.
 * v0.3.0 - Added Tradier Sandbox + bulk/lazy provider modes (was default).
 *          - Verified vs github.io origin: CBOE no CORS (+403 preflight);
 *            Fidelity has no retail API; Yahoo crumb-locked; Google Finance API
 *            discontinued; Barchart no free tier; Nasdaq no CORS. CORS:* winners:
 *            Tradier, marketdata, Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data, Finnhub.
 *          - bulk (one-shot, cached) vs lazy (per-expiration) provider modes;
 *            loadMeta()/loadExpiration() dispatch; asArray() for Tradier quirks.
 * v0.2.0 - Stability & UX overhaul (CORS pain fix): proxies fronting CBOE were
 *          unreliable; made marketdata (AAPL keyless) work, Alpha Vantage as
 *          instant-key, CBOE proxy-only; friendly onboarding + error mapping +
 *          retry + put-call-parity spot estimate + per-provider stored keys.
 * v0.1.0 - Initial baseline: debug system, persistent settings, theme
 *          controller (light/dark/system), DataProvider abstraction, top bar
 *          (brand + API dropdown + theme + gear), ticker search with shake,
 *          expiration strip, Calls|Strike|Puts table, OCC symbol parser.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * COMPANION INFRASTRUCTURE (optional; outside the 3 app source files):
 *   - scripts/fetch_data.py           yfinance -> data/*.json + data/index.json
 *   - .github/workflows/update-data.yml   schedules the fetch + commits JSON
 *   - scripts/yahoo-proxy.ts          local Bun proxy (Yahoo/NASDAQ/CBOE/search)
 *   - scripts/cloudflare-worker.js    deployable proxy (Yahoo/NASDAQ/CBOE/search/raw)
 *
 * WHY THESE API CHOICES (research summary, keep for future agents):
 *   - Dropdown order is fixed: CACHE, CBOE, NASDAQ, YAHOO.
 *   - CACHE (static): same-origin data/*.json -> zero CORS/keys.
 *     DEFAULT selection on hosted/static deploys (GitHub Pages).
 *   - CBOE (via proxy): richest no-key delayed data (greeks/IV/OI/spot).
 *     DEFAULT selection on localhost/LAN when proxy is expected.
 *   - NASDAQ (via proxy): free full-chain, no browser CORS; no IV/greeks in feed.
 *   - YAHOO (via proxy): crumb/cookies handled by companion proxy; lazy per-exp.
 *   - Removed from registry (changelog only): marketdata.app, DoltHub, Tradier,
 *     Alpaca, Alpha Vantage, Polygon/Massive, Finnhub/Twelve Data, etc.
 *
 * DATA FLOW (deferred):
 *   [Get dates] -> loadMeta(symbol) -> ChainMeta{ underlyingPrice, expirations }
 *   [Load]      -> loadExpiration(symbol, exp) -> OptionQuote[] (cached for bulk)
 *               -> (fallback) estimate spot via put-call parity if missing
 *               -> render selected expiration as Calls | Strike | Puts.
 *
 * EXTENSION POINTS (for future features / agents):
 *   - Add a provider: implement DataProvider (bulk or lazy) & push to PROVIDERS.
 *   - Greeks columns / payoff chart: OptionQuote already carries the greeks.
